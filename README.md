This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Clicky-Game
This is my first React app.
## How to Use 
When the page is loaded, parks and rec characters will be displayed 
in random locations on the page. Everytime you click on a character, 
you will score a point and all of the characters' locations 
will be reassigned randomly. If you click on a character twice, you 
lose and the game starts over. If you click on every character once, 
you win and the game starts over. Everytime the game starts over, 
your score for that round will become the new high-score if your 
score is higher than the previous high-score. The current score and 
high-score are displayed on the top of the page for mobile-view, or 
the top-right corner of the page for larger screens.
